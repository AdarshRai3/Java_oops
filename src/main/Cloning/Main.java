        //Due to shallow copy we can see change in value of S1 object type reflects change in value of object type in twin object.

    }
}
//here we can see that the object twin is the copy of S1 in Sheep class but it taking more time by using new keyword to create a copy of object S1
//In twin we are just using excat copy of S1, we can reduce time and esources by using clone method.
//In Java.lang we have interface called as clonable.
// cloning is the process of creating a copy of an object and it is much faster than using constructor(Sheep other){this.age=other.age;this.name=other.name;} 

//the main question that we have here is "This inteface dont have any abstract method then why are you implementing this"
//the simple answer is implements Clonable interface is the way of telling JVM that have to perform clone() method on Object of type Human.
